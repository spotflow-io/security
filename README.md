# Spotflow Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is a newly discovered vulnerability and security issues, we kindly ask our users and security researches to disclose it privately and securely via [GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA)](https://github.com/spotflow-io/security/security/advisories/new) feature on this repository.

Alternatively, the report can be done via email sent to `security@spotflow.io`. However, we prefer GHSA for security reasons.

## Bug Bounty Programs

Currently, we are not running any bug bounty programs.
